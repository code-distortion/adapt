**code-distortion/adapt** is a package for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) that *builds databases for your tests*.



## Features

- Adapt is a [swap-in replacement](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/usage/) for Laravel's `RefreshDatabase`, `DatabaseMigrations`, and `DatabaseTransactions` traits.
- To get the best speeds, your [databases are reused](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/reusing-databases/) (when possible) each time you run your tests.
- A new (experimental MySQL) [journaling method](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/reusing-databases/#journaling) for reusing databases. This is an alternative for when [transactions](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/reusing-databases/#transactions) can't be used (like when browser testing).
- You don't need to create empty databases beforehand. They're [created automatically](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/building-a-database/).
- There's no need to drop or rebuild databases yourself. They are [automatically rebuilt](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/building-a-database/#rebuilding-your-database) when you change your migrations, seeders or factories.
- Lets you [import](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/building-a-database/#imports) custom sql-dump files before running your [migrations](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/building-a-database/#migrations).
- Your tests can use different [seeders](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/building-a-database/#seeders) for different tests, without them needing to be re-run each time.
- You can include [Dusk browser tests](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/browser-testing/) in your normal test run - there's no need to run `php artisan dusk` separately.
- You can [run your tests in parallel](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/parallel-testing/), separate databases are created for each process.
- You can also run [Dusk browser tests](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/browser-testing/) in parallel.
- If your project [has more than one database](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/building-a-database/#building-extra-databases), you can build them as well. Each with their own migrations and seeders.
- If you have two or more Laravel codebases in your project, you can have one [build databases](https://code-distortion.net/docs/adapt/remote-databases/#building-databases-remotely) for the others.

- Improved the logic that purges stale databases. It now only removes databases from connections that are being prepared (unused connections are ignored). Saves long connection time-outs - thanks to [ibrunotome](https://github.com/ibrunotome) for [raising the issue](https://github.com/code-distortion/adapt/issues/2)

### Changed

## [0.11.1] - 2022-06-19

### Added
- Laravel connects to the database in some situations before Adapt runs (e.g. when using debug-bar during remote requests). Adapt now disconnects from these database connections first, so the correct database/s can be re-connected to - thanks to [ibrunotome](https://github.com/ibrunotome) for [raising the issue](https://github.com/code-distortion/adapt/issues/1#issuecomment-1159490719)
- Added separate storage directories for file-based databases (i.e. SQLite), snapshot files, and share-config files
- Added a GitHub issue template
- To help with debugging - The version of PHP, Laravel, PHPUnit, Pest, Adapt, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite are logged
- Included when Pest is being used in the logs



## [0.11.0] - 2022-06-13

### Added
- Added `AdaptDatabase` trait to replace `LaravelAdapt` (which is now deprecated, but will still work)

- Added support for Laravel's `$seeder` test-class property, to indicate which seeder class to run
- Added support for `RefreshDatbase`'s `beforeRefreshingDatabase()` and `afterRefreshingDatabase()` test-class callbacks, which are now called before and after preparing the database, respectively
- Added a new log verbosity setting (0 = minimal, 2 = most details)
- Improved logging output
- Added the option to create file checksums based on their modified times
- Adapt can't run at the same time as Laravel's `RefreshDatabase`, `DatabaseTransactions` and `DatabaseMigrations` traits. Added detection for these, and when also present in a test, an exception is thrown - thanks to [ibrunotome](https://github.com/ibrunotome) for [raising the issue](https://github.com/code-distortion/adapt/issues/1#issuecomment-1153807292)

### Fixed
- Disabled the snapshot setting for SQLite :memory: tests

### Changed
- Renamed *build-hash*, *snapshot-hash* and *scenario-hash* to *build-checksum*, *snapshot-checksum* and *scenario-checksum* (appears in the logs)
- Changed the default method when checking for file changes from "content" to the new method "modified"

## [0.10.2] - 2022-05-22

### Added
- Added the reason why the database couldn't be reused to the logs
- Added (FORCE) when dropping a PostgreSQL database to drop it when other connections exist (falls back to the original query if FORCE isn't available in the current PostgreSQL version) - thanks to [ibrunotome](https://github.com/ibrunotome) for [raising the issue](https://github.com/code-distortion/adapt/issues/1#issuecomment-1133635681)



## [0.10.1] - 2022-05-21

### Added
- Support for PostgreSQL
- The database driver is now included in the list of databases when using adapt:list and adapt:remove

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that stopped config files with a '.' in the filename to be re-initialised when reloading Laravel's config
- Updated logic so snapshot files won't be considered stale when the using a database that doesn't support reuse



## [0.10.0] - 2022-05-17

### Added
- Disabled foreign-id checks in MySQL when reverting journaled changes
- Updated the MySQL journaling code to ignore views when looking for tables to watch
- Updated the MySQL verification code to ignore views when looking for tables to check

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that stopped the `adapt:list` and `adapt:remove` commands from working when the config isn't published
- Fixed a bug stopping SQLite databases from being used when scenarios were enabled

### Changed
- Improved logging output
- Improvements to the way SQLite :memory: databases are handled

### Changed (breaking)
- Updated the SQLite code to require that database filenames don't contain a directory part, just the filename. Now these databases are put into Adapt's `/database/adapt-test-storage` directory automatically - to include them in the housekeeping



## [0.9.2] - 2022-05-07

### Fixed
- Improved the way the service-provider registers the RemoteShareMiddelware - it's now applied it globally, instead of being added to each middleware group
- Updated the service-provider to detect requests from external instances of Adapt (instead of waiting for the middleware to run this check). When detected, it gets Laravel to use the testing environment



## [0.9.1] - 2022-04-19

### Fixed
- Fixed a re-use Journal bug when determining if a table's structure has changed, after its auto-increment value increased



## [0.9.0] - 2022-04-18

### Added
- Added **EXPERIMENTAL** *journaling* functionality for MySQL databases (needs documentation), a new way to re-use databases without using transactions
- Added **EXPERIMENTAL** *database verification* functionality for MySQL databases (needs documentation). This checks the database structure and content after each test has run, to ensure it hasn't changed. This is designed to be used as a safety-check if desired when reusing databases using *journaling* (above). This can be turned on using the `verify_databases` config setting
- Added a check to make sure the `.env.testing` file exists. Laravel falls back to using the `.env` values for its testing environment when `.env.testing` doesn't exist. This can cause unexpected results when wiping and re-building databases
- Added the `check_for_source_changes` config option which allows the `look_for_changes_in` checking to be turned off
- Added a check to see if Laravel's `--recreate-databases` option has been specified when parallel testing. If so, it throws an exception (as `php artisan adapt:remove` should be used instead)
- Added the ability when building databases remotely, for the initial build-hash to be re-used, saving on it's re-calculation during each request
- When a database has been built (or reused) remotely earlier in the test run, this database can now be re-used locally without needing to send extra http requests to build / check it again
- Added the remote-build's error message, to the exception thrown locally when a remote-build fails

### Changed
- When existing databases need to be rebuilt, they're now dropped and re-created (instead of having their contents removed by internally running Laravel's `php artisan db:wipe`)
- Tweaked the descriptions of config values
- Improved logging content, and updated durations to be rendered in milliseconds, seconds and minutes
- Renamed the remote-sharing cookie, which is used for sharing configuration settings between instances of Adapt (e.g. when browser testing), as it seems like it wasn't being passed anymore

### Deprecated
- The test-class property `reuseTestDBs` has been replaced with `$reuseTransaction`
- The config `reuse_test_dbs` setting has been replaced with `reuse.transactions`
- The Builder `reuseTestDBs()` and `noReuseTestDBs()` methods (that you might call in a test's `databaseInit(..)` method) have been replaced with `reuseTransaction()` and `noReuseTransaction()`



## [0.8.0] - 2022-02-23

### Added
- Added an exception when the migrations fail
- Added a check to make sure the local and remote Adapt installations have the same session.driver during browser tests. Otherwise, logins won't be respected by the remote codebase
- Added a check to make sure SQLite databases aren't built remotely - as it doesn't really make sense to do that
- Added a check to make sure SQLite :memory: databases aren't used when browser testing - as this won't work

### Changed
- Made improvements to the logging output
- Added extra checking around the remote-build http request process
- Improvements to the data passed between Adapt installations and processes that handle them
- Now uses Laravel's process to reload Laravel's config (e.g. when switching to the testing environment)
- Improvements when acting as a remote and switching to the testing environment

### Changed (breaking)
- Removed the `--env-file` option from the Adapt console commands
- Changed the normal logging level from "info" to "debug"

### Fixed
- Laravel normally forces `session.driver` to be "array" for tests, but not for `php artisan dusk` tests. To match this functionality, the `session.driver` from the `.env.testing` environment is picked for *browser* tests (even when not explicitly running `php artisan dusk`)
- Fixed the test-class name that's shown in the logs
- Fixed the code that imported new `.env` values, to now properly populate the `env(…)` helper with the new data
- Updated the remote-build code to pick up any url, as long as it ends in the normal remote-build path



## [0.7.0] - 2022-02-10

### Added
- Added support for Laravel 9
- Added **EXPERIMENTAL** *remote-building* functionality (needs documentation)
  - Added config setting: `remove_stale_things` (so the remote Adapt installation has a setting and can be told *not* to remove)
  - Added config setting: `remote_build_url`
  - Added test property: `$remoteBuildUrl`
- Added new helper method `initialiseAdaptIfNeeded($this)` for when Adapt needs to be initialised inside the `setUp()` method
- Added support for Laravel's `$seed = true` property
- Added support for Laravel's `$seeder = 'xyzSeeder'` property (as a string)

### Changed
- Renamed "invalid" databases + snapshot files to "stale"

### Changed (breaking)
- Removed deprecated method `$this->useCurrentConfig(…)`

### Fixed
- Fix when using `$this->newBuilder(…)` method inside a test's `->databaseInit(…)` method
